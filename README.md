# random-team-generator

## What?

A simple, easy to use, webbased team generator.
It allows to build totally random or skill based (but still kinda random) teams.

## Why?

I use this project to learn web development. And I wanted to do something, that might be useful to others too.
This team generator will also be used in another, bigger project i'm working on.
It's a great way to stay motivated and keep learning.
